## Wiki- plain, and unobstrusive
----
Written in a mix of jQuery, mongodb, mongoose, node, and a bunch of node libraries(connect-mongo, cookie-parser and bodyparser), this piece of code lets you create wikis and maintain a revision history. Driven by a all-edits-are-adding-value approach, the base wiki page is the latest revision of the page; there is no approval process for edits.

This in being used in another project where people will collaborate on creating great content.
